## 1: PARTS OF SPEECH

Parts of Speech are the core of the english language. Every word is a part of speech.  
The following parts of speech are defined in this specification:

A. NOUNS            // variables in functional languages or objects and classes in object-oriented languages  
B. PRONOUNS         // pointers  
C. VERBS            // functions, methods, and declarations  
D. ADJECTIVES       // fields  
R. ADVERBS          // TODO: think about adverbs  
F. PREPOSITIONS     // control flow  
G. CONJUNCTIONS     // some builtin keywords  
H. Interjections    // preprocessor/interpreter instructions, like decorators in python and directives in c/c++

### **A: NOUNS**

Nouns store data, or form patterns to store data and execute verbs. 
There are eight types of nouns, and every noun is in four different types:

i.    Common //classes  
ii.   Proper //objects  
iii.  Concrete  
iv.   Abstract   
v.    Regular  
vi.   Irregular  
vii.  Countable  
iix.  Uncountable

#### *I: COMMON NOUNS*

These nouns are patterns - like "classes" in Java - that dictate how proper nouns that are instances of them behave, and what properties they can have.  
New common nouns are designated with a plural suffix (like `s` and `es`), like so:

`Rocks exist` makes a *concrete common* noun called `rock`.

or:

`Potatoes can be interesting, and can be Brown, Purple, Yellow, or Green.` makes a *concrete common* noun called `potato`.

said `potato` has an adjective `interesting`. They can either be
- `interesting` or
- `not interesting`.

said `potato` has a *`colour`,* which is a standard property of all concrete nouns. Valid colours for a `potato` would be:
- `Brown`
- `Purple`
- `Yellow`
- `Green`

`Rocks can be interesting.` would add an adjective to Rocks. This can be queried with a question, like `Is Janet interesting?`

If `Janet` (a proper noun that can be interesting, for instance a rock as defined above) is interesting, it will return `Yes`.   
If `Janet` is not interesting, it will return `No`.

#### *II: PROPER NOUNS*

These nouns are instances of common nouns - like "objects" in java.

#### *III: CONCRETE NOUNS*

These nouns are defined using the verb "to be" and are modified or referenced by verbs. A concrete noun can be common or proper.

for instance:

`Janet is a rock.` would instantiate a new `rock` - a common noun - called `Janet` - a proper noun.

#### *IV: ABSTRACT NOUNS*

TODO: think of something for abstract nouns

#### *V: COLLECTIVE NOUNS*

TODO: think of something for collective nouns

#### *VI: POSSESSIVE NOUNS*



### **G: CONJUNCTIONS**

Conjunctions are built-in keywords that can perform actions on nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. There are three types of conjunction:

- i. Coordinating
- ii. Subordinating
- iii. Correlative

### *I: COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS*



Coordinating conjunctions are
