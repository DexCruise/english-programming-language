1: PARTS OF SPEECH

Parts of Speech are the core of the english language. Every word is a part of speech.  
The following parts of speech are defined in this specification:

a. NOUNS            // variables in functional languages or objects and classes in object-oriented languages  
b. Pronouns         // pointers  
c. Verbs            // functions and methods  
d. Adjectives       // fields  
e. Adverbs          // TODO: think about adverbs--->  
f. Prepositions     // control flow  
g. CONJUNCTIONS     // some builtin keywords  
h. Interjections    // preprocessor/interpreter instructions, like decorators in python and directives in c/c++

**A: NOUNS**

Nouns store data, or form patterns to store data and execute verbs. There are eleven types of nouns. Some nouns belong to multiple types:
[Types of noun](https://7esl.com/types-of-nouns/)

i.    Concrete  
ii.   Abstract  
iii.  Common  
iv.   Proper  
v.    Collective  
vi.   Compound  
vii.  Possessive  
iix.  Regular  
ix.   Irregular  
x.    Countable  
xi.   Uncountable

*I: CONCRETE NOUNS*

These nouns are defined using the verb "to be" and are modified or referenced by verbs. A concrete noun can be common or proper.

for instance:

`Janet is a rock.` would instantiate a new `rock` - a common noun - called `Janet` - a proper noun.

*II: ABSTRACT NOUNS*

TODO: think of something for abstract nouns

*III: COMMON NOUNS*

These nouns are patterns - like "classes" in Java - that dictate how proper nouns that are instances of them behave, and what properties they can have.  
New common nouns are designated with a plural suffix (like `s` and `es`), like so:

`Rocks exist` This makes a concrete common noun called `rock`.

or:

`Potatoes can be interesting, and can be Brown, Purple, Yellow, or Green.` This makes a *concrete common* noun called `potato`.

said `potato` has an adjective `interesting`. They can either be
- `interesting` or
- `not interesting`.

said `potato` has a *`colour`,* which is a standard property of all concrete nouns. Valid colours for a `potato` would be:
- `Brown`
- `Purple`
- `Yellow`
- `Green`

`Rocks can be interesting.` would add an adjective to Rocks. This can be queried with a question, like `Is Janet interesting?`

If `Janet` (a proper noun that can be interesting, for instance a rock as defined above) is interesting, it will return `Yes`.   
If `Janet` is not interesting, it will return `No`.

**G: CONJUNCTIONS**

Conjunctions are built-in keywords that can perform actions on nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. There are three types of conjunction:

    i. Coordinating
ii. Subordinating
iii. Correlative

*I: COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS*

Coordinating conjunctions are
