## How to use the compiler:

The compiler takes only one argument: the file to build.

`python compiler.py helloworld.en` will compile the hello world program.

The compiler makes a new file (or overwrites if it already exists) called `$INPUTFILE.output.py`

For instance, the output file for the hello world program is `helloworld.en.output.py`
